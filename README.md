# Kickstarting with Excel

## Overview of Project

This project looks at how various campaigns performed relative to the launch dates and funding goals. The Kickstarter dataset was used for the analysis


### Purpose
Louise wants to see how the other theater campaigns did relative to her play Fever's campaign.

## Analysis and Challenges
The main challenge finding the correct excel spreadsheet. Then understanding how to correctly create the formulas and charts. 

### Analysis of Outcomes Based on Launch Date

The best time to launch a theater campaign is in  May and June. The least successful launch date is December.

### Analysis of Outcomes Based on Goals

Campaign goals leas than $4999 were successful over 70% of the time. The most successful campaigns were less than $1,000 so a 76% success rate.
Campaigns over $50,000 failed 88% of the time. There was a total of 16 campaigns over $50,000. That higher amount campaign was the least successful.
There was one campaign between $45,000 to $49,000 that was the anomaly of having one campaign. The one campaign failed.

### Challenges and Difficulties Encountered
The challenge was understanding how to read the charts. The critical thinking that goes into interpreting the results of the charts.
## Results

Theater campaigns are not huge money makers. The smaller the campaign goal, the most likely the success of the campaign. 

- What are two conclusions you can draw about the Outcomes based on Launch Date?

Theater campaigns have a higher success rate in May and Juny. December is the worst time to launch a theater campaign.

- What can you conclude about the Outcomes based on Goals?

The smaller the campaign goal the more successfuel. Goals less than $4999 had the best sucess rate. 
Out of 720 campaigns for less than $4,999, 191 were not successful.

- What are some limitations of this dataset?

The dataset doesn't take into consideration what audiences want to see and like. 


- What are some other possible tables and/or graphs that we could create?

The number of successful and failed television campaigns would be interesting to see. Then compare that to the theater success/failure rate.
